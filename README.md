### 👋 Hi there,  

My name is Youn and I'm a geek 🎩. I am a front-end and back-end developer 👩🏾‍💻  who spends so many hours a day and night in front of a computer 🧑🏾‍💻 to code and debug until I get the result that I need and want to get. I would dive fearlessly into the sea of chaotic world of coding whenever I face problems that might take days to solve 🔓. I believe if I really understand the logic behind the one coding language, I would learn other languages much easier than the the previous language learning experience 🏆. 

I am passionate about building interfaces that are user-friendly and pleasant for the most number of people as possible ❤️🍸. If you found value in what I have created, please feel free to email me @
