#### 👋 Hi there,  

I am a front-end and back-end develper who loves to code and enjoy it so much!
I’m Nicholas, but people call me “Nas.” I’m a frontend developer, and I specialize in efficient React apps and CSS & HTML that just work across all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.




I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about python and data engineering. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. You can see a full list of what I am up to on waylonwalker.com. If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a tip, give me a shout out @_waylonwalker, give some ♥ on DEV.to/waylonwalker, or sign up for my newsletter at waylonwalker.com/newsletter I would love to see you join.
